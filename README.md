# deviceVis
A d3 visualisation of data being pushed to the store API to be used on Data / Tech courses.

This Visualisation will retrieve data from the Decoded store api: http://form.decoded.co/#store.

Data can be stored in the API using the Arduino Proxy tool.

The data must be stored with at least the variable "value".
